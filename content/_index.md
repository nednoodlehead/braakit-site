We are an IT company based out of Powell River, British Columbia. We were formed Mid-2022 as a sole proprietorship after the Covid-19 restrictions were lessened and
opportunities arose.
We aim to serve our community that is underserviced for this industry.

We are committed to bringing a wide range of high-quality services to our clients for a competitive price.

# Key Services
Our key services include:
- IT Support

# Where do you operate?

We do IT support for the Powell River area only. The exception is remote work that does not require on-site presence. This may change eventually however, as we expand our area of service.
